# TALLER DE ARBOLES BINARIOS

A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure that organizes data hierarchically, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. In a BST, each node contains a value, and it follows two key properties: 

The value of every node in the left subtree is less than the value of the node itself. 
The value of every node in the right subtree is greater than the value of the node itself. 
These properties ensure that search operations can be performed in O(log n) time on average, making BSTs an efficient choice for storing and retrieving ordered data. Make your impelmentation compatible with Java Collectios API. 

## Features

- **Insertion**: Add elements to the tree while maintaining the binary search property.
- **Deletion**: Remove elements from the tree, with appropriate adjustments to maintain structure.
- **Search**: Efficiently find elements in the tree.
- **Traversal**: Support for in-order and level-order traversal to retrieve elements in a sorted order.
- **Utility Methods**: Methods to find the minimum and maximum elements, calculate the height of the tree, and count the number of nodes.
